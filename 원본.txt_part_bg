title.flowofplay=Flow of Play
rule.eachturn=Each turn is split into three phases: Birdsong, Daylight, and Evening. Once you play through these phases in order, your turn ends, and the next player in the turn order takes their turn.
title.howtowin=How to Win
rule.howtowin=You can win in one of two ways: score 30 victory points or play and complete a dominance card. See the <link="dominance"><color=#462C1B><u>Dominance Cards section</u></color></link>.

title.undergroundduchy=Underground Duchy
rule.marq=The invading Marquise de Cat wishes to exploit the Woodland, using its vast resources to fuel her economic and military machine. She scores by constructing buildings in the Woodland.
rule.eyrie=The proud Eyrie Dynasties wish to reclaim the glory of their once-great aristocracy and retake the Woodland from the Marquise. They score each turn by building and protecting roosts in the Woodland.
rule.alli=The upstart Woodland Alliance wish to unite the creatures of the forest and rise up against their oppressors. They score by spreading sympathy for their cause across the Woodland.
rule.vaga=The wily Vagabond wishes to gain fame—or infamy—in the midst of this brewing conflict. He scores by completing quests for the creatures of the Woodland and by aiding and harming the other factions.
title.themap=The Map
rule.themap=Most action in Root unfolds on the map of the Woodland, consisting of 12 clearings connected by paths.
title.moving=Moving Around the Map
rule.movingaround=You can move from clearing to clearing. When you move, take any number of your warriors from one clearing and move them to a clearing connected by a path.\
rule.forests=The spaces on the map enclosed by paths are forests, which only the Vagabond can move into.
title.clearings=Clearings
rule.clearings=Each clearing on the map has one to three slots, which hold buildings that players will place. A clearing with no open slots cannot hold more buildings.\
rule.ruins=Slots filled with ruins cannot hold buildings until the Vagabond explores them. Without a Vagabond, these slots will be blocked for the entire game.
title.cards=The Cards
rule.cards=Throughout play, you will draw cards from Root’s shared deck into your hand, and many actions will require you to spend cards from your hand. Spending a card represents calling upon animals to lend you their labor, to do you a favor, or to broker a deal.\
Just like clearings, each card has a suit. Besides the <sprite name="mouseicon">, <sprite name="foxicon">, and <sprite name="rabbiticon"> suits, cards have a fourth suit: <sprite name="birdicon">. <sprite name="birdicon"> are "wild" and can be used as if it was a mouse, fox, or rabbit card. However, if you must spend a <sprite name="birdicon"> card, you can’t substitute a card of another suit.
title.crafting=Crafting Cards
rule.crafting=Most cards have a second use—you can craft the card to gain its effect, shown at the bottom.\
<margin=3em>∙Marquise crafts with workshops.\
∙Vagabond crafts with hammers</margin=3em>\
title.battling=Battling
rules.battling=You can battle other players to remove their pieces from the map. <br><br>When you battle, choose any clearing where you have any warriors. You are the attacker, and you choose another faction with any pieces there as the defender.<br><br>To determine hits, two dice are rolled with sides 0-3. The attacker deals max hits equal to the higher die, and the defender deals max hits equal to the lower die. However, each player can deal no more hits than their number of warriors in the clearing of battle. The player taking hits chooses which pieces to remove, but must remove all their own warriors in the clearing of battle before removing any of their own buildings or tokens there.<br><br><style=RSH>Victory Points</style><br><br>Whenever you cause an enemy building or token to be removed—even outside battle—you score a victory point!<br><br><style=RSH>Extra Hits</style><br><br>Some effects allow you to deal extra hits. Extra hits represent superior positioning, tactics, or leadership. They are not limited by the number of warriors in the clearing of battle, so a single warrior could deal multiple hits.<br><br>The attacker deals an extra hit if the defender has no warriors in the clearing of battle, leaving themselves defenseless.
rules.marq=The Marquise de Cat occupies the Woodland and wants to turn it into an industrial and military powerhouse. Each time the Marquise builds one of her buildings—a workshop, sawmill, or recruiter—she scores victory points. The more of the same building she has on the map, the more points she scores. However, to fuel ongoing construction, the Marquise must maintain and protect a strong, interconnected economy of wood.
title.setup=Setup
rules.marqsetup=<style=RSH>Setup</style><br><br>∙Draw 3 cards.<br>∙Place your keep token in the corner clearing of your choice.<br>∙You gain 1 warrior in each clearing except the corner clearing diagonally opposite from your keep. <br>∙Place 1 sawmill, workshop, and recruiter among the clearing with the keep token and any adjacent ones.
title.thekeep=The Keep
rules.thekeep=The Keep of Marquise de Cat grants two special abilities while it is on the map. First, no one but the Marquise can place pieces in the clearing with the Keep token. Also, whenever Marquise warriors are removed, the Marquise may call on her Field Hospitals, spending a card matching the warriors’ clearing to place them back in the clearing with the Keep token. This ability can be used instantly to rescue warriors removed from the Keep clearing and at the start of the Marquise turn for warriors removed from other clearings.
rules.marqturn=<style=RSH><sprite index=66>Birdsong </style><br><br>Each sawmill generates a wood token.<br><br><style=RSH><sprite index=65>Daylight</style><br><br>First, you can craft any cards in your hand using workshops.<br><br>Then, you can take up to three of the following actions:<br><br><style=RB>Battle:</style> Initiate a battle.<br><style=RB>March:</style> Take two moves.<br><style=RB>Recruit:</style> Place one warrior at each recruiter. You may take this action only once per turn.<br><style=RB>Build:</style> Place one building in a clearing you rule with an open slot by spending wood tokens equal to its cost. You may spend any wood on the map connected to this clearing by any number of clearings you rule. When you place the building, score the victory points shown on your building track.<br><style=RB>Overwork:</style> Spend a card to place one wood token at one sawmill in a clearing whose suit matches the card spent.
rules.hawks=Hawks for Hire: You may take any number of extra actions by spending one bird card per extra action.
rules.marqeve=<style=RSH><sprite index=64>Evening</style><br><br>Draw one card, plus one card per uncovered draw bonus. Then, if you have more than five cards in your hand, discard down to five.
rules.eyrie=The Eyrie Dynasties wish to restore their once-dignified kind to their former glory in the Woodland by resettling the forest clearings. During their Evening, the Eyrie score victory points from their number of roosts on the map. The greater their presence, the greater their gains. However, the Eyrie are bound by their Decree, an ever-increasing set of mandated actions promised by their leader. Each turn, they must take all of the actions on their Decree, or else fall into turmoil.
rules.eyriesetup=<style=RSH>Setup</style><br><br>∙Draw 3 cards.<br>∙You get 6 warriors and 1 roost in the corner clearing diagonally opposite from the clearing with the keep. If the Marquise is not playing, place these pieces in the corner clearing of your choice.<br>Choose a leader.</margin=3em>
rule.emergencyorders=Emergency Orders: If you have no cards at the start of Birdsong, draw one.
rule.newroost=A New Roost: If you have no roosts, place one roost and three warriors in the clearing with the fewest warriors.
rule.eyrieturn=<style=RSH>Abilities</style><br><br>The Eyrie are the Lords of the Forest. They rule a clearing when tied for most combined warriors and buildings, and they have at least one Eyrie piece there. However, their Disdain for Trade means they only score 1 victory point when crafting items. <br><br><style=RSH><sprite index=66>Birdsong</style><br><br>You must add one or two cards onto any columns in the Decree. Only one card added may be a bird card.<style=RSH><br><br><sprite index=65>Daylight</style><br><br>First, you may craft any number of cards, using roosts.<br>Then, you must resolve the Decree, starting with the leftmost column and moving right. <br>For each card in a column, you must take the action listed by the column in a clearing matching the card.<br><br>Here are the actions in the four columns of the Decree:<br><br><style=RB>Recruit</style>: Place a warrior in a matching clearing with a roost.<br><style=RB>Move</style>: Move at least one warrior from a matching clearing.<br><style=RB>Battle</style>: Initiate a battle in a matching clearing.<br><style=RB>Build</style>: Place a roost in a matching clearing you rule with an open slot and no roost.<br><br><style=RSH><sprite index=64>Evening</style><br><br>First, score the victory points shown on the rightmost empty space of your roosts track.<br>Then, draw one card, plus one per uncovered draw bonus. If you have more than five cards in your hand, discard down to five.<br><br><style=RSH>Turmoil</style><br><br>If you cannot take an action for any reason, you fall into turmoil. The following steps occur:<br><margin=3em>∙First, your regime is humiliated. Lose one victory point per bird card in the Decree.<br>∙Then, your court is purged. Discard all of the cards in the Decree<br>∙Next, your leader is deposed. You must choose a new leader to take their place. <br>∙Finally, you rest. End Daylight and go to Evening.</margin=3em>
rule.turmoil=There are many ways to fall into turmoil! For example, you might not have any warriors in your supply to recruit, or maybe all the clearings you rule already have a roost, meaning you can’t build any more.
rules.alliance=The Woodland Alliance works to gain the sympathy of the various oppressed creatures of the Woodland. Each time the Alliance places a sympathy token, they may score victory points. The more sympathy on the map, the more victory points they score. Gaining the sympathy of the people requires supporters. These supporters can also be put toward violent revolt. A revolt establishes a new base, allowing the Alliance to train officers that increase their military flexibility.
rules.allisetup=<style=RSH>Setup</style><br><br>∙Draw 3 cards<br>∙Gain 3 supporters in random suits.
rules.baseremoval=Whenever a base is removed, you lose half your officers (rounded up) and discard all supporters matching the suit of that base—even your bird supporters!
rules.spreadsympathy=<style=RB>Spread Sympathy:</style> Place a sympathy token in an unsympathetic clearing, adjacent to a sympathetic clearing if possible. You must spend supporters as shown by the cost on your Sympathy track. If the target clearing has three or more warriors of another player, you must spend another matching supporter to place sympathy there.
rules.nosympathy=If there are no sympathy tokens on the board, you can place your first sympathy in any clearing.

Score the revealed victory points.<br>After you finish military operations, draw one card, plus one additional card per base you have on the map. Then, if you have more than five cards in your hand, discard down to five.
rules.vaga=The Vagabond plays all sides of the conflict, making friends and enemies as suit his ends, while going on quests to increase his renown throughout the woodland.

rules.vagabonusdraw=Unlike other factions, the Vagabond does not uncover draw bonuses, but instead gets draw bonuses from <sprite name="coinstack">. This item only adds a bonus draw if it is undamaged and unexhausted.
rules.vagarelationships=<style=RSH>Relationships</style><br><br>Your Relationships chart represents how friendly or hostile other factions are toward you.<br>You can improve a relationship with a faction by giving them cards with the Aid action.
