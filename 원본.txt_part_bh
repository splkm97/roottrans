Unlike the Vagabond, the Vagabot treats all items as identical (for example, there is no difference between <sprite name="torch"> and <sprite name="hammer">). He exhausts undamaged items, to take many actions. <br><br><b>Battle Track:</b> Unlike the Vagabond, the Vagabot does not use swords to determine hits in battle. Instead, the Vagabot’s maximum rolled hits in battle begins at one. While the Vagabot has at least six, nine, and twelve undamaged items, an item is placed in the Vagabot’s Battle Track. The sixth and ninth item slots each increase his maximum rolled hits by one, and the twelfth makes him deal one extra hit as attacker in battle. Items on the Battle Track cannot be exhausted, but they can be damaged.<br><br><b>Taking Hits:</b> When the Vagabot takes hits, he damages exhausted items or, if he has no exhausted items, unexhausted items.

rules.coop=To win, the human/AI players must each score 30 victory points before any clockwork bot player does. Bots do not treat other bot pieces as enemy pieces when targeting a clearing to act in, and do not target each other in battle. However, a bot might still remove bot pieces as collateral damage with effects such as revolts. The human/AI players still treat each other as enemies (so they can remove buildings and tokens for points, etc.).<br><br>Dominance cards are removed during Co-op play.

rules.lizard=The Cult relies on word of mouth and beak to spread its gospel, and new enclaves can spring up anywhere on the map. Where the Cult rules clearings, they can build gardens, which will further radicalize the animals that live there. While other factions spend cards to achieve their aims, the Cult acts chiefly by revealing cards and gradually drafting the ideal set of followers. Unless used for scoring, these cards are not spent and are returned to the Cult’s hand during Evening. However, this gentler approach makes movement and battle difficult, so these actions can only be undertaken by the most radicalized members of the Cult—their acolytes

rule.mountainmap2=A path covered with a closed path marker is a closed path. Clearings linked by a closed path are not adjacent. However, closed paths enclose and divide forests exactly as paths do. Once per turn in Daylight, a player can spend a card to remove a closed path marker and score 1 victory point.

rule.corvidplots3=Plot tokens can be removed by enemy players just like any other token can. Also, enemy players can attempt to remove facedown plot tokens by <b>Exposure:</b> Any number of times before drawing cards in their Evening, an enemy player with a piece in a clearing with a facedown plot token may show the Corvids a card matching that clearing to guess the plot’s type. If they are correct, they remove the token (scoring a point) and ignore its effect. If incorrect, the token remains face down, and they give the card to the Corvids.
rule.corvidabilities=To protect their plot tokens, the Corvids will need to move their warriors deep within enemy territory. Thankfully, their warriors are <b>Nimble</b>, so they ignore rule while moving. Additionally, their <b>Embedded Agents</b> provide effective protection. Whenever the Corvids are defending in battle in a clearing with a facedown plot token, they deal an extra hit— even if the plot token is defenseless!

rule.duchyintro=The Duchy has long looked with suspicion on the surface dwellers. The vast wealth of the underground seemed more than enough to satiate their ambitions. Now, however, the stores are dwindling, and the Duchy looks to the great Woodland for expansion. To succeed, they must sway ministers to join their cause and direct the Duchy’s wealth toward this endeavor, providing extra actions and scoring means. The Duchy sways ministers by revealing cards matching clearings where the Duchy has any number of pieces, representing their successes in establishing frontier outposts. Ultimately, the Duchy will need to construct markets and citadels to justify their conquest and gain more support from Woodland separatists.
rule.duchysetup=<style=RSH>Setup</style><br><br>Place 2 warriors and 1 tunnel in the corner clearing diagonally opposite from the clearing with the keep token. If the Marquise is not playing, place those pieces in the corner clearing of your choice. Place 2 warriors in each clearing adjacent to that corner clearing.

rule.duchyabilities=The Duchy recruits its warriors in a special clearing called <b>The Burrow</b>. This clearing is off the map and has no building slots, but is adjacent to every clearing with a tunnel token. Because of its peculiar construction, only Duchy warriors can enter the Burrow.<br><br>The eyes of the Duke are trained on the Woodland campaign. When any number of Duchy buildings are removed, the Duchy must pay the <b>Price of Failure</b>, discarding a random card and returning their swayed minister of highest rank to their Unswayed Ministers pile.
rule.duchyBirdsong=<style=RSH><sprite index=66>Birdsong</style> <br><br>Place one warrior, plus one warrior for each uncovered warrior icon on the Citadels track, in the Burrow.
rule.duchydaylight=<style=RSH><sprite index=65>Daylight</style> <br><br>First, take up to two of the following actions:<br><br><style=RB>Build:</style> Reveal a card to place a market or citadel in a matching clearing you rule. <br><style=RB>Recruit:</style> Place one warrior in the Burrow.<br><style=RB>Move:</style> Take a move.<br><style=RB>Battle:</style> Initiate a battle.<br><style=RB>Dig:</style> Spend a card to place a tunnel token in a matching clearing with no tunnel, then move up to four warriors from the Burrow into that clearing. If all of the tunnels are already on the map, you may remove a tunnel at the start of this action.<br><br>After taking these actions, you may act with any of your swayed ministers in any order:<br><br><b>Foremole:</b> Reveal any card to place a citadel or market in any clearing (matching or not) you rule.<br><b>Captain:</b> Initiate a battle.<br><b>Marshal:</b> Take a move.<br><b>Brigadier:</b> Take up to two moves or initiate up to two battles.<br><b>Banker:</b> Spend any number of cards (even one) of the same suit to score victory points in equal number.<br><b>Mayor:</b> Take the action of any swayed noble or squire.<br><b>Duchess of Mud:</b> Score 2 victory points if all three tunnels are on the map.<br><b>Baron of Dirt:</b> Score <sprite name="1VP"> per market on the map.<br><b>Earl of Stone:</b> Score <sprite name="1VP"> per citadel on the map.<br><br>Finally, you may sway an unswayed minister. To do so, you must reveal a number of cards based on the minister’s rank—a squire needs two cards, a noble needs three, and a lord needs four. However, you can only reveal cards matching clearings where you have any pieces, and each of those clearings lets you reveal only one card. Additionally, you lose one of your three starting crowns of that Ministers rank and can't sway any more of that type after those three crowns are spent. <br><br>Finally, score victory points equal to its rank (Squire: <sprite name="1VP">, Noble: <sprite name="2VP">, Lord: <sprite name="3VP">)
rule.duchyevening=<style=RSH><sprite index=64>Evening</style> <br><br>Discard any bird cards you revealed this turn, and return all the other cards you revealed this turn to your hand. Then, you can craft by activating citadels and markets—they’re treated the same here. Next, draw one card plus one card per uncovered draw bonus. Last, discard down to five cards.
rule.corvidconspiracy=The Corvid Conspiracy hatches plots to fund their criminal operations and terrorize their opponents until they strong-arm the Woodland into submission. The Corvids score victory points based on how many plots are revealed on the map.
rule.undergroundduchy=The Underground Duchy lead their assault from below using tunnels to mobilize throughout the map, swaying ministers to join their cause. The Duchy construct markets and citadels to justify their conquest and gain more support from Woodland separatists.
rules.keepers.1=The Keepers in Iron are an order of exiled knights who have returned to recover <b>relics</b> lost in bygone conflicts.
rules.keepers.2=First, they must <b>delve</b> relics out of the forests, then move the relics to their <b>waystations</b>, where they can finally <b>recover</b> them to score points. But they must plan carefully, since they rely on their <b>Retinue</b> of Woodland locals, who might go missing—or worse—as they help the Keepers delve and recover the relics they seek.
rules.keepers.setup.1=<style=RSH>Setup</style><br><br><b>Step 1: Add Relics to Forests</b><br>The 12 relics are shuffled and one is randomly added face down to each forest.<br>Its type will be shown while face down but not its value.

rules.keepers.birdsong.1=<style=RSH><sprite index=66>Birdsong</style> <br><br><b>First, Encamp.</b> In any number of clearings, you may replace a Keeper warrior with a waystation building. Your waystations have two sides, and you can place the waystation on either side.
rules.keepers.birdsong.2=Each waystation shows what type of relic you can recover at it. For example, this waystation lets you recover either figures or jewelry, depending on which side you place face up. There are three types of relics: figures, jewelry, and tablets.
rules.keepers.birdsong.3=You cannot encamp in the same clearing multiple times in a turn.
rules.keepers.birdsong.4=You can encamp a waystation in a clearing that already has a waystation from a previous turn!
rules.keepers.birdsong.5=If you have no warriors or waystations on the map at all, you may place one warrior and one waystation in any edge clearing.
rules.keepers.birdsong.6=<b>Second, Decamp.</b> Decamp is essentially the opposite of Encamp. In any number of clearings, you may replace a waystation with a Keeper warrior. Likewise, you cannot decamp in the same clearing multiple times in a turn.
rules.keepers.birdsong.7=<b>Third, Recruit.</b> Any number of times, you may spend a card to place two warriors at a matching waystation.
rules.keepers.birdsong.8=Yes, you can place six or eight or even ten warriors down on a single waystation if you have the cards for it!
rules.keepers.daylight.1=<style=RSH><sprite index=65>Daylight</style> <br><br><b>First, Craft.</b> This is a standard Craft action that uses your waystations, regardless of type.<br><br><b>Second, Act With Retinue.</b> You may take one action per card in your Retinue, located along the top of your faction board, from left to right. Take the action listed by the card’s action slot in a clearing that matches the card’s suit.
rules.keepers.daylight.2=The Retinue works like the Eyrie’s Decree, but you may skip actions without penalty.
rules.keepers.daylight.3=<b>Move:</b> The left action slot lets you move from the matching clearing.
rules.keepers.daylight.4=<b>Battle then Delve:</b> The middle action slot lets you battle and then delve. If you take this action, you must battle in the clearing you’re acting in, unless there are no enemy pieces you can battle there. Then you may delve in the same clearing. Here’s how delving works… If you rule the clearing and have a Keeper warrior there, you may move a relic from any adjacent forest into the clearing, and then flip the relic over to reveal its value.
