Unlike the Vagabond, the Vagabot treats all items as identical (for example, there is no difference between <sprite name="torch"> and <sprite name="hammer">). He exhausts undamaged items, to take many actions. <br><br><b>Battle Track:</b> Unlike the Vagabond, the Vagabot does not use swords to determine hits in battle. Instead, the Vagabot’s maximum rolled hits in battle begins at one. While the Vagabot has at least six, nine, and twelve undamaged items, an item is placed in the Vagabot’s Battle Track. The sixth and ninth item slots each increase his maximum rolled hits by one, and the twelfth makes him deal one extra hit as attacker in battle. Items on the Battle Track cannot be exhausted, but they can be damaged.<br><br><b>Taking Hits:</b> When the Vagabot takes hits, he damages exhausted items or, if he has no exhausted items, unexhausted items.

rules.coop=To win, the human/AI players must each score 30 victory points before any clockwork bot player does. Bots do not treat other bot pieces as enemy pieces when targeting a clearing to act in, and do not target each other in battle. However, a bot might still remove bot pieces as collateral damage with effects such as revolts. The human/AI players still treat each other as enemies (so they can remove buildings and tokens for points, etc.).<br><br>Dominance cards are removed during Co-op play.

rules.lizard=The Cult relies on word of mouth and beak to spread its gospel, and new enclaves can spring up anywhere on the map. Where the Cult rules clearings, they can build gardens, which will further radicalize the animals that live there. While other factions spend cards to achieve their aims, the Cult acts chiefly by revealing cards and gradually drafting the ideal set of followers. Unless used for scoring, these cards are not spent and are returned to the Cult’s hand during Evening. However, this gentler approach makes movement and battle difficult, so these actions can only be undertaken by the most radicalized members of the Cult—their acolytes

rule.mountainmap2=A path covered with a closed path marker is a closed path. Clearings linked by a closed path are not adjacent. However, closed paths enclose and divide forests exactly as paths do. Once per turn in Daylight, a player can spend a card to remove a closed path marker and score 1 victory point.

rule.corvidplots3=Plot tokens can be removed by enemy players just like any other token can. Also, enemy players can attempt to remove facedown plot tokens by <b>Exposure:</b> Any number of times before drawing cards in their Evening, an enemy player with a piece in a clearing with a facedown plot token may show the Corvids a card matching that clearing to guess the plot’s type. If they are correct, they remove the token (scoring a point) and ignore its effect. If incorrect, the token remains face down, and they give the card to the Corvids.
rule.corvidabilities=To protect their plot tokens, the Corvids will need to move their warriors deep within enemy territory. Thankfully, their warriors are <b>Nimble</b>, so they ignore rule while moving. Additionally, their <b>Embedded Agents</b> provide effective protection. Whenever the Corvids are defending in battle in a clearing with a facedown plot token, they deal an extra hit— even if the plot token is defenseless!

rule.corvidevening=<style=RSH><sprite index=64>Evening</style> <br><br>Draw one card plus one card per face-up extortion token on the map. Then, discard down to five cards.
rule.duchyintro=The Duchy has long looked with suspicion on the surface dwellers. The vast wealth of the underground seemed more than enough to satiate their ambitions. Now, however, the stores are dwindling, and the Duchy looks to the great Woodland for expansion. To succeed, they must sway ministers to join their cause and direct the Duchy’s wealth toward this endeavor, providing extra actions and scoring means. The Duchy sways ministers by revealing cards matching clearings where the Duchy has any number of pieces, representing their successes in establishing frontier outposts. Ultimately, the Duchy will need to construct markets and citadels to justify their conquest and gain more support from Woodland separatists.
rule.duchysetup=<style=RSH>Setup</style><br><br>Place 2 warriors and 1 tunnel in the corner clearing diagonally opposite from the clearing with the keep token. If the Marquise is not playing, place those pieces in the corner clearing of your choice. Place 2 warriors in each clearing adjacent to that corner clearing.
rule.duchysupply=<style=RSH>Supply</style><br><br>∙Warriors x20<br>∙Citadels x3<br>∙Markets x3<br>∙Tunnels x3<br>∙Squire Crowns x3<br>∙Noble Crowns x3<br>∙Lord Crowns x3<br>∙Minister Crowns x9
rule.duchyabilities=The Duchy recruits its warriors in a special clearing called <b>The Burrow</b>. This clearing is off the map and has no building slots, but is adjacent to every clearing with a tunnel token. Because of its peculiar construction, only Duchy warriors can enter the Burrow.<br><br>The eyes of the Duke are trained on the Woodland campaign. When any number of Duchy buildings are removed, the Duchy must pay the <b>Price of Failure</b>, discarding a random card and returning their swayed minister of highest rank to their Unswayed Ministers pile.
rule.duchyBirdsong=<style=RSH><sprite index=66>Birdsong</style> <br><br>Place one warrior, plus one warrior for each uncovered warrior icon on the Citadels track, in the Burrow.
rule.duchydaylight=<style=RSH><sprite index=65>Daylight</style> <br><br>First, take up to two of the following actions:<br><br><style=RB>Build:</style> Reveal a card to place a market or citadel in a matching clearing you rule. <br><style=RB>Recruit:</style> Place one warrior in the Burrow.<br><style=RB>Move:</style> Take a move.<br><style=RB>Battle:</style> Initiate a battle.<br><style=RB>Dig:</style> Spend a card to place a tunnel token in a matching clearing with no tunnel, then move up to four warriors from the Burrow into that clearing. If all of the tunnels are already on the map, you may remove a tunnel at the start of this action.<br><br>After taking these actions, you may act with any of your swayed ministers in any order:<br><br><b>Foremole:</b> Reveal any card to place a citadel or market in any clearing (matching or not) you rule.<br><b>Captain:</b> Initiate a battle.<br><b>Marshal:</b> Take a move.<br><b>Brigadier:</b> Take up to two moves or initiate up to two battles.<br><b>Banker:</b> Spend any number of cards (even one) of the same suit to score victory points in equal number.<br><b>Mayor:</b> Take the action of any swayed noble or squire.<br><b>Duchess of Mud:</b> Score 2 victory points if all three tunnels are on the map.<br><b>Baron of Dirt:</b> Score <sprite name="1VP"> per market on the map.<br><b>Earl of Stone:</b> Score <sprite name="1VP"> per citadel on the map.<br><br>Finally, you may sway an unswayed minister. To do so, you must reveal a number of cards based on the minister’s rank—a squire needs two cards, a noble needs three, and a lord needs four. However, you can only reveal cards matching clearings where you have any pieces, and each of those clearings lets you reveal only one card. Additionally, you lose one of your three starting crowns of that Ministers rank and can't sway any more of that type after those three crowns are spent. <br><br>Finally, score victory points equal to its rank (Squire: <sprite name="1VP">, Noble: <sprite name="2VP">, Lord: <sprite name="3VP">)
rule.duchyevening=<style=RSH><sprite index=64>Evening</style> <br><br>Discard any bird cards you revealed this turn, and return all the other cards you revealed this turn to your hand. Then, you can craft by activating citadels and markets—they’re treated the same here. Next, draw one card plus one card per uncovered draw bonus. Last, discard down to five cards.
rule.corvidconspiracy=The Corvid Conspiracy hatches plots to fund their criminal operations and terrorize their opponents until they strong-arm the Woodland into submission. The Corvids score victory points based on how many plots are revealed on the map.
rule.undergroundduchy=The Underground Duchy lead their assault from below using tunnels to mobilize throughout the map, swaying ministers to join their cause. The Duchy construct markets and citadels to justify their conquest and gain more support from Woodland separatists.
rules.keepers.1=The Keepers in Iron are an order of exiled knights who have returned to recover <b>relics</b> lost in bygone conflicts.
rules.keepers.2=First, they must <b>delve</b> relics out of the forests, then move the relics to their <b>waystations</b>, where they can finally <b>recover</b> them to score points. But they must plan carefully, since they rely on their <b>Retinue</b> of Woodland locals, who might go missing—or worse—as they help the Keepers delve and recover the relics they seek.
rules.keepers.setup.1=<style=RSH>Setup</style><br><br><b>Step 1: Add Relics to Forests</b><br>The 12 relics are shuffled and one is randomly added face down to each forest.<br>Its type will be shown while face down but not its value.
rules.keepers.relics=<style=RSH>4x Tablet Relics</style><br>    Values of 1, 2, 3, 3<br><br><style=RSH>4x Figure Relics</style><br>    Values of 1, 2, 3, 3<br><br><style=RSH>4x Jewelry Relics</style><br>    Values of 1, 2, 3, 3
rules.keepers.setup.2=<b>Step 2: Place Warriors</b><br><br>Place 4 warriors in a corner clearing that another player has not chosen as their starting clearing, then place 4 warriors in an adjacent clearing on the map edge.
rules.keepers.setup.3=<b>Step 3: Distribute Remaining Relics</b><br><br>All remaining relics not played during step 1 will be added face down, as evenly as able, among forests not adjacent to your starting clearings.
rules.keepers.setup.4=<b>Step 4: Faithful Retainers</b><br><br>A Faithful Retainer card is added into each of your Retinue columns.
rules.keepers.supply=<style=RSH>Supply</style><br><br>∙Warriors x15<br>∙Waystations x3 (double-sided)
rules.keepers.birdsong.1=<style=RSH><sprite index=66>Birdsong</style> <br><br><b>First, Encamp.</b> In any number of clearings, you may replace a Keeper warrior with a waystation building. Your waystations have two sides, and you can place the waystation on either side.
rules.keepers.birdsong.2=Each waystation shows what type of relic you can recover at it. For example, this waystation lets you recover either figures or jewelry, depending on which side you place face up. There are three types of relics: figures, jewelry, and tablets.
rules.keepers.birdsong.3=You cannot encamp in the same clearing multiple times in a turn.
rules.keepers.birdsong.4=You can encamp a waystation in a clearing that already has a waystation from a previous turn!
rules.keepers.birdsong.5=If you have no warriors or waystations on the map at all, you may place one warrior and one waystation in any edge clearing.
rules.keepers.birdsong.6=<b>Second, Decamp.</b> Decamp is essentially the opposite of Encamp. In any number of clearings, you may replace a waystation with a Keeper warrior. Likewise, you cannot decamp in the same clearing multiple times in a turn.
rules.keepers.birdsong.7=<b>Third, Recruit.</b> Any number of times, you may spend a card to place two warriors at a matching waystation.
rules.keepers.birdsong.8=Yes, you can place six or eight or even ten warriors down on a single waystation if you have the cards for it!
rules.keepers.daylight.1=<style=RSH><sprite index=65>Daylight</style> <br><br><b>First, Craft.</b> This is a standard Craft action that uses your waystations, regardless of type.<br><br><b>Second, Act With Retinue.</b> You may take one action per card in your Retinue, located along the top of your faction board, from left to right. Take the action listed by the card’s action slot in a clearing that matches the card’s suit.
rules.keepers.daylight.2=The Retinue works like the Eyrie’s Decree, but you may skip actions without penalty.
rules.keepers.daylight.3=<b>Move:</b> The left action slot lets you move from the matching clearing.
rules.keepers.daylight.4=<b>Battle then Delve:</b> The middle action slot lets you battle and then delve. If you take this action, you must battle in the clearing you’re acting in, unless there are no enemy pieces you can battle there. Then you may delve in the same clearing. Here’s how delving works… If you rule the clearing and have a Keeper warrior there, you may move a relic from any adjacent forest into the clearing, and then flip the relic over to reveal its value.
rules.keepers.daylight.5=Each relic type has four tokens with the same values—1, 2, 3, and 3. Every relic starts on its side with no value. When delved, it flips to show its value.
rules.keepers.daylight.6=Once you’ve delved a relic, count how many clearings you rule adjacent to the forest you delved from—basically, all the clearings that are touching the forest. If you rule fewer of these clearings than the relic’s value, you must discard the card in your Retinue you used to delve.
rules.keepers.daylight.7=∙<b>Move or Recover:</b> The right action slot lets you move or recover relics from a matching clearing, your choice. Here’s how recovering works… One at a time, you may take any number of relics from the clearing you’re acting in. However, you can only take a relic if the clearing has a waystation of the same type: figure, tablet, or jewelry. When you take a relic, put it on your faction board in the leftmost empty Relics space of its type. Then, count how many clearings you rule that match the suit of the clearing you’re acting in, including that clearing. If you rule fewer of these clearings than the relic’s value, you must discard the card in your Retinue you used to recover it, then end the action. When you recover a relic, you score points equal to its value, and you score two more points if it fills a Relics column.
rules.keepers.evening.1=<style=RSH><sprite index=64>Evening</style> <br><br><b>First, Live Off the Land.</b> In each clearing that has four or more Keeper warriors, you must remove one Keeper warrior.<br><br><b>Second, Gather Retinue.</b> You may add any number of cards from your hand to any action slots in your Retinue. However, your Retinue cannot hold more than ten cards at a time.
rules.keepers.evening.2=If you don’t add any cards, you may shift exactly one card in your Retinue to any other Retinue action slot.<br><br><b>Third, Draw and Discard.</b> You draw one card, plus one card for each waystation on the map. Then, if you have more than five cards, you discard down to five cards.
rules.hundreds.1=Claiming to be the one true voice of the Woodland, the Lord of the Hundreds consolidates power by crushing all dissent.
rules.hundreds.2=In their Evening, they score points based on how many clearings they <b>oppress</b>—clearings they rule that have no enemy pieces at all. Their swarming army is led by the <b>warlord</b>, a warrior-demagogue whose shifting <b>mood</b> provides fleeting advantages.
rules.hundreds.3=By piling items onto their towering <b>Hoard</b>, the Hundreds grow in <b>Command</b> and <b>Prowess</b>, which let them take more actions and attract more warriors to their warlord. If that is not enough, they can incite torch-wielding <b>mobs</b> to raze the Woodland.
rules.hundreds.setup.1=<style=RSH>Setup</style><br><br><b>Step 1: Place Warriors</b><br><br>Place your warlord, four warriors, and one stronghold in a corner clearing that is not the starting corner clearing of another player and, if possible, is diagonally opposite from a starting corner clearing.
rules.hundreds.setup.2=<b>Step 2: Place Items</b><br><br>The 4 items are distributed among the ruins if this has not already been done (typically by the Vagabond being in the game).
rules.hundreds.setup.3=<b>Step 3: Starting Mood</b><br><br>Start with the Stubborn mood in the mood slot. (This means on your first turn, you will pick any mood except Stubborn.)
rules.hundreds.supply=<style=RSH>Supply</style><br><br>∙Warriors x20<br>∙Strongholds x6<br>∙Mobs x5
rules.hundreds.birdsong.1=<style=RSH><sprite index=66>Birdsong</style> <br><br><b>First, Raze.</b> In each clearing with a mob token, remove all enemy buildings and tokens. If a ruin is there, take an item from it and add the item to your Hoard. <br><br>Whenever you gain an item, it is placed in the leftmost empty space of your Hoard that shows that item type. Boots, bags, and coins increase your Command, while hammers, tea, swords, and the crossbow increase your Prowess.
rules.hundreds.birdsong.2=After you resolve all your mobs, roll the mob die once—no matter how many mobs are on the map! Place one mob token in a clearing that matches the suit you rolled on the mob die. This clearing must be adjacent to a clearing that already has a mob, and a clearing cannot have multiple mobs.
rules.hundreds.birdsong.3=<b>Second, Recruit.</b> Place warriors equal in number to your Prowess in the clearing with your warlord. Then, place one warrior at each stronghold building.<br><br><b>Third, Anoint.</b> If your warlord is not on the map, you'll need a new one! Replace any Hundreds warrior on the map with your warlord. If you cannot—for example, if you have no warriors on the map—then put your warlord in any clearing.
rules.hundreds.birdsong.4=<b>Fourth, Choose Your Mood.</b>  Here, you must replace your current mood card with a different one. You cannot choose a mood if you have the item in your Hoard that the mood card shows in its top-left corner. One mood, Lavish, does not show an item. You can always choose it as long as you’re not currently Lavish. If you are Lavish and you have every type of item in your Hoard, though, you will stay Lavish.
rules.hundreds.daylight.1=<style=RSH><sprite index=65>Daylight</style> <br><br><b>First, Craft.</b> This is a standard Craft action that uses your strongholds.<br><br><b>Second, Command the Hundreds.</b> You may take these actions in any order, a number of times up to your Command:
rules.hundreds.daylight.2=∙<b>Move:</b> Take one move.<br>∙<b>Battle:</b> Initiate a battle.<br>∙<b>Build:</b> Spend a card to place a stronghold in a matching clearing you rule.
rules.hundreds.daylight.3=<b>Third, Advance the Warlord.</b> You may advance your warlord a number of times equal to your Prowess. Whenever you advance, you may move, and then you may battle—neither is required. The move must include your warlord, but you can also move warriors along with your warlord, and the battle must be in your warlord’s clearing.
rules.hundreds.evening.1=<style=RSH><sprite index=64>Evening</style> <br><br><b>First, Incite.</b> Any number of times, you may spend a card to place a mob token in a matching clearing with a Hundreds warrior, even your warlord. A clearing cannot have multiple mobs.
rules.hundreds.evening.2=You don’t need to place mobs adjacent to clearings that already have a mob, like you do when you roll the mob die in your Raze step.
rules.hundreds.evening.3=<b>Second, Oppress.</b> You score points based on how many clearings you rule that have a Hundreds piece and no enemy pieces at all—no warriors, no tokens, no building, nothing.
rules.hundreds.evening.4=<b>Third, Draw and Discard.</b> You draw one card. If you have more than five cards, you discard down to five.
rules.hundreds.evening.5=If you want to draw more cards, choose your Rowdy mood!
rules.hundreds.ability.1=<style=RSH>The Looters Ability</style> <br><br>This is how your Looters ability works. In battle as the attacker, you can choose to loot the defender. You still roll, but you deal no rolled hits, but the defender still does. At the end of battle, if you rule the clearing where you just battled, you may take any one item from the defender’s Crafted Items box.
rules.hundreds.ability.2=Notably, you cannot loot the Vagabond, who does not have a Crafted Items box.
rules.keepers.desc=The Keepers in Iron are an order of devout knights, once exiled from the Woodland, who have returned to recover relics lost in past conflicts. They score by recovering relics at their waystations.
rules.hundreds.desc=The Lord of the Hundreds suffers no fools and allows no dissent. During their Evening, they score points based on how well they oppress their foes. The more clearings they rule that have a Hundreds piece and no enemy pieces the more points they score.
emote.dominance.marquise=Strafe to the left, strike to the right!
emote.dominance.eyrie=Hold on to your feathers. We have a new path to victory ahead.
emote.dominance.alliance=Change of plans friends. They will never know what hit em!
