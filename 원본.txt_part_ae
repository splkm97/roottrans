cct.Birdsong.t1.recruit=Now the games really begin. In Birdsong, you may spend a card from your hand to place one <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warrior</color> in each clearing matching its suit.
cct.Birdsong.t2.craft=Your <color=#6B5182>plots</color> on the map (hidden or not) contribute the suit of their clearing towards crafting during Birdsong.
cct.Birdsong.t2.flip.1=Next, you can reveal <color=#6B5182>plots</color> in clearings where you have at least one <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warrior</color>. Start by revealing your <sprite name="plot_extortion"> <color=#6B5182>Extortion plot</color> to steal a card.<br>Each revealed <sprite name="plot_extortion"> will also draw you an extra card in Evening.
cct.Birdsong.t2.flip.2=When you reveal a <sprite name="Plot"> <color=#6B5182>plot</color>, you score <sprite name="1VP"> for each revealed <sprite name="Plot"> <color=#6B5182>plot token</color> on the map.
cct.Birdsong.t2.recruit=Finally, let's discard a card to recruit again. Do so now in <sprite name="ClearingMouse"> clearings.
cct.Birdsong.t3.flip.1=We have nothing to craft this turn, so we skip to revealing <color=#6B5182>plots</color>. <color=#6B5182>Reveal</color> your <sprite name="plot_snare"> <color=#6B5182>Snare</color> to enable its <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warrior</color> trapping effect and gain <sprite name="2VP">.
cct.Birdsong.t3.flip.2=Remember, when you reveal a <color=#6B5182>plot</color>, you score <sprite name="1VP"> for each revealed <color=#6B5182>plot</color> token on the map. The more revealed <color=#6B5182>plots</color> you keep defended, the greater your scoring potential.
cct.Birdsong.t3.flip.3=Next reveal your <sprite name="plot_raid"> <color=#6B5182>Raid</color> to score <sprite name="3VP">. Its effect only occurs when removed from the map, but revealing it is still useful for scoring.
cct.Birdsong.t3.recruit=Recruit to <sprite name="ClearingMouse"> clearings.
cct.Birdsong.t4.flip=We can't reveal our <sprite name="plot_bomb"> <color=#6B5182>Bomb plot</color> because we don't have a <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warrior</color> there. But don't fret! It's better to wait to reveal a <sprite name="plot_bomb"> in clearings with enemy pieces to destroy anyway.
cct.Birdsong.t4.recruit=Send your <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warriors</color> out to the <sprite name="ClearingFox"> clearings.
cct.Daylight.t1.actions=In Daylight, we may take up to 3 of the following actions.<br><sprite name="UIMoveToken">Move<br><sprite name="UIBattleToken">Battle<br><sprite name="CorvidPlotToken">Plot<br><sprite name="CorvidTrickToken">Trick<br>
cct.Daylight.t1.move.1=Use the Move action to consolidate your <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warriors</color> into a clearing closer to your enemy.
cct.Daylight.t1.move.2=Move again to continue your march towards the <color=#336699>Eyrie's</color> forces.
cct.Daylight.t1.plot=Let's start with what we <color=#6B5182>Corvid</color> do best, plotting!
cct.Daylight.t1.plot.extortion=We have a variety of <color=#6B5182>plots</color> at our disposal. <sprite name="plot_extortion"> <color=#6B5182>Extort</color> the <color=#336699>Eyrie</color> to improve our flow of cards.
cct.Daylight.t1.plot.hidden=The <color=#336699>Eyrie</color> can see a <color=#6B5182>plot</color> was hatched, but they won't know the type of <color=#6B5182>plot</color> until you choose to reveal it.
cct.Daylight.t1.plot.sacrifice=Plotting requires sacrifice. Your first <color=#6B5182>plot</color> of the turn costs you one <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warrior</color> in its clearing. Each successive <color=#6B5182>plot</color> of the turn will require one <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warrior</color> more than the last.
cct.Daylight.t2.bird.expose=What is this plot you have hatched near our <sprite name="Roost"><color=#336699>roost</color>? It cannot stand, I say! It must be exposed!
cct.Daylight.t2.bird.guess=I bet you conniving <sprite name="corvid"> <color=#6B5182>Corvid</color> laid a <sprite name="plot_snare"> <color=#6B5182>Snare</color> in our <sprite name="Roost"><color=#336699>roost</color>!
cct.Daylight.t2.embedded=An unflappable defense! Your <sprite name="EmbeddedAgents"> <color=#6B5182>Embedded Agents</color> ability adds a hit to defending battles where you have a hidden <color=#6B5182>plot</color> token.
cct.Daylight.t2.exposure.1=Anytime before drawing cards in Evening, an enemy may try to <color=#6B5182>Expose</color> your <color=#6B5182>plot</color> by correctly guessing what the <color=#6B5182>plot</color> is. As the cost to do so they must reveal a card matching the suit of its clearing.
cct.Daylight.t2.exposure.2=If they are correct, you must discard your <color=#6B5182>plot</color>, ignoring its effect. If they are wrong, you get their revealed card.
cct.Daylight.t2.exposure.result=The squabbling <color=#336699>Eyrie</color> fell for our bluff. Their guess is wrong, and we get to take their card.
cct.Daylight.t2.move.1=For your first Daylight action, move your <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warriors</color> into the <color=#336699>Eyrie's</color> starting <sprite name="Roost"><color=#336699>roost</color> to prepare for new <color=#6B5182>plots</color>.
cct.Daylight.t2.plot.raid=Place a <sprite name="plot_raid"> <color=#6B5182>Raid plot</color> where you moved your <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warriors</color>. If it is removed in an attack, you place a <color=#6B5182>warrior</color> in each adjacent clearing.
cct.Daylight.t2.plot.snare=Next we will remove 2 <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warriors</color> to set a <sprite name="plot_snare"> <color=#6B5182>Snare plot</color> for the <color=#336699>Eyrie</color>. Once revealed, it will stop enemies from being able to move warriors out of its clearing or place new pieces there.
cct.Daylight.t3.bird.turmoil=The <color=#336699>Despot</color> has failed us. Time to bring in a true leader, the <color=#336699>Commander</color>.
cct.Daylight.t3.move=Use your next action to consolidate your <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warriors</color>.
cct.Daylight.t3.plot=When placing a <color=#6B5182>plot</color>, you must choose a clearing that doesn't already have one.
cct.Daylight.t3.plot.bomb=Place the <sprite name="plot_bomb"> <color=#6B5182>Bomb plot</color> to see if we can make things go BOOM!
cct.Daylight.t3.trick.1=Finally, we'll trick the <color=#336699>Eyrie</color> into <color=#336699>Turmoil</color>. Use <color=#6B5182>Trick</color> to swap the location of your revealed <sprite name="plot_raid"> <color=#6B5182>Raid</color> and <sprite name="plot_snare"> <color=#6B5182>Snare plots</color>.
cct.Daylight.t3.trick.2=The <sprite name="plot_snare"> <color=#6B5182>Snare</color> will keep them from being able to move out of that clearing or recruit <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warriors</color> in it. That ought to ruffle some feathers and send them into <color=#336699>Turmoil</color>.
cct.Daylight.t4.battle.1=Now that you are in position, itâ€™s time to fight!
cct.Daylight.t4.battle.2=Their <sprite name="Roost"><color=#336699>roost</color> is defenseless! Attack again to finish them off.
cct.Daylight.t4.move=With your enemy's leadership in disarray, it's a perfect time for a show of strength. Move your <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warriors</color> to take the battle to the <color=#336699>Eyrie</color>.
cct.Daylight.t4.nimble=What Nimble movement you have! Like the <color=#4E6F89>Vagabond</color>, <color=#6B5182>Corvid <sprite name="corvid">warriors</color> move regardless of clearing rule restrictions.
cct.Daylight.t4.offrails=You should be in a strong position to take it from here. Score <style="vpnumddteen">15</style> or destroy enemy pieces with a <sprite name="plot_bomb"> <color=#6B5182>Bomb</color> to finish this scenario.
cct.Evening.t1.draw=Evening calls. With your Daylight actions complete, you will draw a card and pass the turn to the <color=#336699>Eyrie</color>.
cct.Evening.t2.end=Looks like the pieces are all in place. But before our <color=#6B5182>plots</color> hatch we must pass to the <color=#336699>Eyrie</color> to take their turn.
cct.Evening.t2.exert=In Evening, you may skip drawing cards to <sprite name="CorvidExertToken"> <color=#6B5182>Exert</color> for an extra action. We have more to accomplish, so let's do it.
cct.Evening.t2.move=Move a <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warrior</color> down to our <sprite name="plot_snare"> <color=#6B5182>Snare</color> to ensure we have the <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warrior</color> required to reveal it next turn.
cct.goal.15vp=Score <style="vpnumddteen">15</style> ({0}/{1})<br><br>-OR-<br><br>
cct.goal.bomb=Destroy 1 or more enemy pieces with a <sprite name="plot_bomb"> <color=#6B5182>Bomb</color>.
cct.intro=Welcome, initiate! Today marks your induction into the great <color=#6B5182>Corvid Conspiracy</color>, the true power pulling the strings in this woodland war.<br><br>To succeed as a member of the <color=#6B5182>Corvid Conspiracy</color> requires careful planning and the utmost secrecy. Our foes will never see us coming as we spread our plots far and wide across the woodlands.
cct.setup.warriors=During setup, our initial foothold in the woodlands is established by placing a <sprite name="corvid"><color=#6B5182>warrior</color> in one of each clearing suit.
